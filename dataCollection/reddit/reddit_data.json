Yet, India's willingness to play Pakistan in multilateral events while refusing bilateral tours, reflects a double standard\n\nThis is prioritizing commercial interests (e.g., viewership and revenue from India-Pakistan matches) over a principled stance, unlike the South Africa boycott\n\nplaying cricket with Pakistan, even in neutral venues, sends a message of normalcy in bilateral relations despite ongoing conflicts. India should adopt a blanket boycott, as it did with South Africa, to signal zero tolerance for Pakistan's hostility\n\nIf BCCI is private entity, why it doesn't plays bilateral? If government has some control over it, then Narendra Modi & Amit Shah should be questioned for allowing this Asia Cup Participation\n\nSeveral countries actively boycott each other in sporting events due to political, ideological, border-related, or human rights issues: Iran - Israel Russia - Ukraine Arab Countries -Israel",

But now, I don't care about the 2 points we will lose in ICC.\n\nIf banning Pak from ICC is not an option because Jay Shah is the chairman and it will look like india is just bullying pak and they will become victim gaining support of other boards.\n\nThen we should just boycott the ICC. Say that it's either India or Pak. If you guys want to continue with Pak. Many congratulations to you we are out and we dgaf.\n\nThen don't buy the broadcasting rights in India. Don't give them any viewership from India and then let's see how much money can ICC make from a tournament without Indan team and Indian viewership.\n\nNothing will happen if we don't play 2 ICC tournaments. We will keep playing bilateral with other nations and IPL. We should also make a mandate that if you go to PSL then you will be banned from IPL forever.\n\nCountry is more important than cricket. Our soldiers are fighting, our citizens are watching drones and missiles fly over them and on the other we play cricket with them?\n\nNO, Impossible...",

They also see India necessary to revenue realization from the event \n\nMost of the Indians explained the problem from a security angle - what if there is a breach\u2026. While many took the political angle - that ICT\/BCCI wants to play but it\u2019s Modi\/ Indian govt who wants to avoid it.zzz\n\nI honestly think it\u2019s a matter of moral principles. Why would India contribute to revenues of PCB when the taxes they pay are going to be directly used against India. It is exactly same as boycotts of coke and McDonald\u2019s happening in a lot of Muslim countries (including Pakistan) - the logic is why contribute to companies who are supporting Israel. So why can\u2019t India have the same right to boycott the companies \/ organizations that go against its interest.\n\nWhat do you all think? A. Is India justified in boycotting B. Should India go play CT25 and not try for hybrid model? ",

This is a highly disrespectful way of treating your cricketers,\u201d \n\n\"The government of Pakistan changed the whole constitution of PCB just to accommodate Najam Sethi. I have never seen this ever in my life,\"\n\n\"Najam Sethi doesn't know how many months he has to stay in PCB. He has no interest in Pakistan Cricket. He only wants authority in PCB.\"\n\n\"Najam Sethi attacked on PCB headquarter in such a manner that I was unable to take my baggage from my office. They attacked PCB like an FIA raid.\"\n\n\"I believe in authoritative captain but Babar Azam has to bring improvement in his captaincy,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The new hierarchy in PCB will put pressure on Babar Azam because the captain now has to work with a new management of PCB during ongoing season,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way India announced that they won\u2019t play Asia Cup in Pakistan wasn\u2019t right. They issued the statement without consulting Asian Cricket Council members. India should not have tried to boss Pakistan or any other country like this,\u201d\n\n\"I would have had no problem if BCCI had said India cannot participate in Asia Cup 2023 because they cannot travel to Pakistan but BCCI cannot take a unilateral decision of taking Asia Cup out of Pakistan at a neutral venue.\n\n\"BCCI should not bring politics in cricket. Cricket fans in India want to see Shaheen [Afridi] and Babar [Azam] play in India whereas Pakistani cricket fans want [Virat] Kohli and KL Rahul play in Pakistan. However the decision by BCCI on Asia Cup has developed hatred between Pakistan and India.\"\n\n\"I have got great regard for Indian fans, I have absolutely enjoyed my stint over the years in India. There is no doubt in this. Cricket breaks barriers, it helps transcend barriers. As a cricketer, as a commentator, I have gotten a lot of love,\" \n\n\"Problems start when you run the cricket administration, then you have to take strong decisions. Those strong decisions are judged by the Indian perspective, the fans and the cricket board in Pakistan are looking at their own benefits. They are looking at those calls from their own perspective.\n\n\"The problem started when we got the Asia Cup hosting rights and then India thought we won't go to Pakistan and because of that Asia Cup will be held in a neutral country, it can't be held in Pakistan. As you know, big international teams weren't coming to Pakistan, and after a long time, Pakistan is getting to host an international tournament. I took my stand based on that,\"\n\n\"Leadership is very important when you are running cricket. We challenged England, we challenged New Zealand when they went back, they returned to play. England played extra matches too also,\"\n\n\"That's why it's important to take a stand for us.\n\n\"This was not even news to me, because it was a done deal that Pakistan will host the Asia Cup. To withdraw the hosting rights without any meeting, without any conversation, without any committee. No Asia Cup member also knew this.\"\n\n\"When any country tries to boss, then it becomes a problem. Suddenly, we took a stand against India and that situation won't be painted in India that way. They will obviously say \"who are they to challenge us?\"\n\n\"That's why I would keep telling Babar Azam it's important to win against India... If we are not competitive against them (India), they will not regard as us a superpower in cricket. We have to prove it again and again. We have also beaten India twice recently,\"\n\n\"To bring just one person you changed the entire constitution of Pakistan Cricket Board. I have never seen this happen in the world that to adjust Najam Sethi, you had to change the constitution,\" \n\n\"In the middle of the season, when teams are coming to play in Pakistan, you have done this, and then you changed the chief selector. The point is that Mohammad Wasim whether he was doing a good job or not, is a former Test cricketer, and you should have made him leave with respect,\"\n\n\"This Najam Sethi is tweeting 2:15am at night that Ramiz Raja has been sacked, star congratulating me. I have played Test cricket, this is my field, and it hurts to see these people from outside cricket trying to act like a Messiah. I know that their motives are non-cricketing. These people are here for the limelight,\"\n\n\"I am going to Oxford Union to give a lecture. I am going to raise this matter on international forums. Is this is a joke' People are angry over this. Whether someone is performing or not is a different matter, if there's a tenure system, they should be allowed to complete the term before a change is made,\"\n\n\n\n[Source 1](https:\/\/cricketpakistan.com.pk\/en\/news\/detail\/he-only-wants-authority-has-no-interest-in-pakistan-cricket-ramiz-slam)\n\n[Source 2](https:\/\/www.geosuper.tv\/latest\/21263-india-should-not-try-to-boss-pakistan-ramiz-raja)\n\n[Source 3](https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/sports\/cricket\/story\/ramiz-raja-interview-pcb-chairman-india-boycott-2023-world-cup-babar-azam-2313810-2022-12-26)\n\n[Source 4](https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/amp\/sports\/cricket\/story\/pakistan-cricket-board-najam-sethi-ramiz-raja-sacked-2313827-2022-12-26)\n\nEdit:\n\n\"We are ill-prepared for Test match cricket. After a long time, we had a tough season and were exposed. Whether it was pitches, quality of cricket,\" said Ramiz on his official YouTube channel.\n\n\"We couldn't even catch up with the speed of England. And maybe a lot of teams won't be able to catch up with them. They won a match against India and they did something similar where Bairstow scored an excellent run-a-ball hundred. But a positive spin to that is our run-rate has improved.\n\n\"But I think our white-ball fast bowlers, and I told them to be fit for Test match cricket. Our talent pool is not very vast. There is potential but we have only 3-4 match winners. And unfortunately, three of them were injured. Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi picked up injuries.\n\n\"So it becomes very difficult when your frontline bowlers get injured all of a sudden. We need to work on this and I was frustrated as well because I was repeating that our strength is fast bowling.\"\n\n\n\"And our pitches are extremely dead, we have tried a lot. We got curators from other countries and right now we have soil from Australia. We have spent money on that and the plan was to get more bounce in these wickets to prepare competitive wickets. But the positive is that we still got results in all three matches. \n\n\"I think Pakistan could've saved one and won the other Test match, but still it is a lesson. I hope we will be well prepared in the future for red-ball cricket,\" he remarked.",

    "selftext":"Farewell, America - BillMoyers\\_com\n\nNo matter how the rest of the world looked at us on Nov. 7, they will now look at us differently.\n\nBy Neal Gabler | November 10, 2016\n\nAmerica died on Nov. 8, 2016, not with a bang or a whimper, but at its own hand via electoral suicide. We the people chose a man who has shredded our values, our morals, our compassion, our tolerance, our decency, our sense of common purpose, our very identity \u2014 all the things that, however tenuously, made a nation out of a country.\n\nWhatever place we now live in is not the same place it was on Nov. 7. No matter how the rest of the world looked at us on Nov. 7, they will now look at us differently. We are likely to be a pariah country. And we are lost for it. As I surveyed the ruin of that country this gray Wednesday morning, I found weary consolation in W.H. Auden\u2019s poem, September 1, 1939, which concludes:\n\n\u201cDefenseless under the night\n\nOur world in stupor lies;\n\nYet, dotted everywhere,\n\nIronic points of light\n\nFlash out wherever the Just\n\nExchange their messages:\n\nMay I, composed like them\n\nOf Eros and of dust,\n\nBeleaguered by the same\n\nNegation and despair,\n\nShow an affirming flame.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hunt for that affirming flame.\n\nThis generally has been called the \u201chate election\u201d because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election because, and let\u2019s not mince words, of the hatefulness of the electorate. In the years to come, we will brace for the violence, the anger, the racism, the misogyny, the xenophobia, the nativism, the white sense of grievance that will undoubtedly be unleashed now that we have destroyed the values that have bound us.\n\nWe all knew these hatreds lurked under the thinnest veneer of civility. That civility finally is gone. In its absence, we may realize just how imperative that politesse was. It is the way we managed to coexist.\n\nIf there is a single sentence that characterizes the election, it is this: \u201cHe says the things I\u2019m thinking.\u201d That may be what is so terrifying. Who knew that so many tens of millions of white Americans were thinking unconscionable things about their fellow Americans? Who knew that tens of millions of white men felt so emasculated by women and challenged by minorities? Who knew that after years of seeming progress on race and gender, tens of millions of white Americans lived in seething resentment, waiting for a demagogue to arrive who would legitimize their worst selves and channel them into political power? Perhaps we had been living in a fool\u2019s paradise. Now we aren\u2019t.\n\nThis country has survived a civil war, two world wars, and a great depression. There are many who say we will survive this, too. Maybe we will, but we won\u2019t survive unscathed. We know too much about each other to heal. No more can we pretend that we are exceptional or good or progressive or united. We are none of those things. Nor can we pretend that democracy works and that elections have more or less happy endings. Democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process.\n\nThe virus that kills democracy is extremism because extremism disables those codes. Republicans have disrespected the process for decades. They have regarded any Democratic president as illegitimate. They have proudly boasted of preventing popularly elected Democrats from effecting policy and have asserted that only Republicans have the right to determine the nation\u2019s course. They have worked tirelessly to make sure that the government cannot govern and to redefine the purpose of government as prevention rather than effectuation. In short, they haven\u2019t believed in democracy for a long time, and the media never called them out on it.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t cope with extremism. Only violence and time can defeat it. The first is unacceptable, the second takes too long. Though Trump is an extremist, I have a feeling that he will be a very popular president and one likely to be re-elected by a substantial margin, no matter what he does or fails to do. That\u2019s because ever since the days of Ronald Reagan, rhetoric has obviated action, speechifying has superseded governing.\n\nTrump was absolutely correct when he bragged that he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn\u2019t care. It was a dictator\u2019s ugly vaunt, but one that recognized this election never was about policy or economics or the \u201cright path\/wrong path,\u201d or even values. It was about venting. So long as Trump vented their grievances, his all-white supporters didn\u2019t care about anything else. He is smart enough to know that won\u2019t change in the presidency. In fact, it is only likely to intensify. White America, Trump\u2019s America, just wants to hear its anger bellowed. This is one time when the Bully Pulpit will be literal.\n\nThe media can\u2019t be let off the hook for enabling an authoritarian to get to the White House. Long before he considered a presidential run, he was a media creation \u2014 a regular in the gossip pages, a photo on magazine covers, the bankrupt (morally and otherwise) mogul who hired and fired on The Apprentice. When he ran, the media treated him not as a candidate, but as a celebrity, and so treated him differently from ordinary pols. The media gave him free publicity, trumpeted his shenanigans, blasted out his tweets, allowed him to phone in his interviews, fell into his traps and generally kowtowed until they suddenly discovered that this joke could actually become president.\n\nJust as Trump has shredded our values, our nation and our democracy, he has shredded the media. In this, as in his politics, he is only the latest avatar of a process that began long before his candidacy. Just as the sainted Ronald Reagan created an unbridgeable chasm between rich and poor that the Republicans would later exploit against Democrats, conservatives delegitimized mainstream journalism so that they could fill the vacuum.\n\nRetiring conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes complained that after years of bashing from the right wing, the mainstream media no longer could perform their function as reporters, observers, fact dispensers, and even truth tellers, and he said we needed them. Like Goebbels before them, conservatives understood that they had to create their own facts, their own truths, their own reality. They have done so, and in so doing effectively destroyed the very idea of objectivity. Trump can lie constantly only because white America has accepted an Orwellian sense of truth \u2014 the truth pulled inside out.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s election, I think that the ideal of an objective, truthful journalism is dead, never to be revived. Like Nixon and Sarah Palin before him, Trump ran against the media, boomeranging off the public\u2019s contempt for the press. He ran against what he regarded as media elitism and bias, and he ran on the idea that the press disdained working-class white America. Among the many now-widening divides in the country, this is a big one, the divide between the media and working-class whites, because it creates a Wild West of information \u2013 a media ecology in which nothing can be believed except what you already believe.\n\nWith the mainstream media so delegitimized \u2014 a delegitimization for which they bear a good deal of blame, not having had the courage to take on lies and expose false equivalencies \u2014 they have very little role to play going forward in our politics. I suspect most of them will surrender to Trumpism \u2014 if they were able to normalize Trump as a candidate, they will no doubt normalize him as president. Cable news may even welcome him as a continuous entertainment and ratings booster. And in any case, like Reagan, he is bulletproof. The media cannot touch him, even if they wanted to. Presumably, there will be some courageous guerillas in the mainstream press, a kind of Resistance, who will try to fact-check him. But there will be few of them, and they will be whistling in the wind. Trump, like all dictators, is his own truth.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump already has promised to take his war on the press into courtrooms and the halls of Congress. He wants to loosen libel protections, and he has threatened Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos of Amazon with an antitrust suit. Individual journalists have reason to fear him as well. He has already singled out NBC\u2019s Katy Tur, perhaps the best of the television reporters, so that she needed the Secret Service to escort her from one of his rallies. Jewish journalists who have criticized Trump have been subjected to vicious anti-Semitism and intimidation from the alt-right. For the press, this is likely to be the new normal in an America in which white supremacists, neo-Nazi militias, racists, sexists, homophobes and anti-Semites have been legitimized by a new president who \u201csays what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d It will be open season.\n\nThis converts the media from reporters to targets, and they have little recourse. Still, if anyone points the way forward, it may be New York Times columnist David Brooks. Brooks is no paragon. He always had seemed to willfully neglect modern Republicanism\u2019s incipient fascism (now no longer incipient), and he was an apologist for conservative self-enrichment and bigotry. But this campaign season, Brooks pretty much dispensed with politics. He seemed to have arrived at the conclusion that no good could possibly come of any of this and retreated into spirituality. What Brooks promoted were values of mutual respect, a bolder sense of civic engagement, an emphasis on community and neighborhood, and overall a belief in trickle-up decency rather than trickle-down economics. He is not hopeful, but he hasn\u2019t lost all hope.\n\nFor those of us now languishing in despair, this may be a prescription for rejuvenation. We have lost the country, but by refocusing, we may have gained our own little patch of the world and, more granularly, our own family. For journalists, Brooks may show how political reporting, which, as I said, is likely to be irrelevant in the Trump age, might yield to a broader moral context in which one considers the effect that policy, strategy and governance have not only on our physical and economic well-being but also on our spiritual well-being. In a society that is likely to be fractious and odious, we need a national conversation on values. The media could help start it.\n\nBut the disempowered media may have one more role to fill: They must bear witness. Many years from now, future generations will need to know what happened to us and how it happened. They will need to know how disgruntled white Americans, full of self-righteous indignation, found a way to take back a country they felt they were entitled to and which they believed had been lost. They will need to know about the ugliness and evil that destroyed us as a nation after great men like Lincoln and Roosevelt guided us through previous crises and kept our values intact. They will need to know, and they will need a vigorous, engaged, moral media to tell them. They will also need us.\n\nWe are not living for ourselves anymore in this country. Now we are living for history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeal Gabler is an author of five books and the recipient of two LA Times Book Prizes, Time magazine's non-fiction book of the year, USA Today's biography of the year and other awards.

Now it has been substantiated by none other than right-wing columnist George Will.\n\nNixon's newly revealed records show for certain that in 1968, as a presidential candidate, he ordered Anna Chennault, his liaison to the South Vietnam government, to persuade them to refuse a cease-fire being brokered by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nNixon's interference with these negotiations violated President John Adams's 1797 Logan Act, banning private citizens from intruding into official government negotiations with a foreign nation.\n\nPublished as the 40th Anniversary of Nixon's resignation approaches, Will's column confirms that Nixon feared public disclosure of his role in sabotaging the 1968 Vietnam peace talks. Will says Nixon established a \"plumbers unit\" to stop potential leaks of information that might damage him, including documentation that he believed was held by the Brookings Institute, a liberal think tank. The Plumbers' later break-in at the Democratic National Committee led to the Watergate scandal that brought Nixon down.\n\nNixon's sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks was confirmed by transcripts of FBI wiretaps. On November 2, 1968, LBJ received an FBI report saying Chernnault told the South Vietnamese ambassador that \"she had received a message from her boss: saying the Vietnamese should \"hold on, we are gonna win.\"\n\nAs Will confirms, Vietnamese did \"hold on,\" the war proceeded and Nixon did win, changing forever the face of American politics\u2014with the shadow of treason permanently embedded in its DNA.\n\nThe treason came in 1968 as the Vietnam War reached a critical turning point. President Lyndon Johnson was desperate for a truce between North and South Vietnam. \n\nLBJ had an ulterior motive: his Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, was in a tight presidential race against Richard Nixon. With demonstrators in the streets, Humphrey desperately needed a cease-fire to get him into the White House. \n\nJohnson had it all but wrapped it. With a combination of gentle and iron-fisted persuasion, he forced the leaders of South Vietnam into an all-but-final agreement with the North. A cease-fire was imminent, and Humphrey\u2019s election seemed assured.\n\nBut at the last minute, the South Vietnamese pulled out. LBJ suspected Nixon had intervened to stop them from signing a peace treaty. \n\nIn the Price of Power (1983), Seymour Hersh revealed Henry Kissinger\u2014then Johnson\u2019s adviser on Vietnam peace talks\u2014secretly alerted Nixon\u2019s staff that a truce was imminent. \n\nAccording to Hersh, Nixon \u201cwas able to get a series of messages to the Thieu government \\[of South Vietnam\\] making it clear that a Nixon presidency would have different views on peace negotiations.\u201d\n\nJohnson was livid. He even called the Republican Senate Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen, to complain that \u201cthey oughtn\u2019t be doing this. This is treason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d was Dirksen\u2019s feeble reply.\n\nJohnson blasted Nixon about this on November 3rd, just prior to the election. As Robert Parry of [Consortiumnews.com](https:\/\/Consortiumnews.com) has written: \u201cwhen Johnson confronted Nixon with evidence of the peace-talk sabotage, Nixon insisted on his innocence but acknowledged that he knew what was at stake.\u201d \n\nSaid Nixon: \u201cMy, I would never do anything to encourage\u2026.Saigon not to come to the table\u2026.Good God, we\u2019ve got to get them to Paris or you can\u2019t have peace.\u201d\n\nBut South Vietnamese President General Theiu\u2014a notorious drug and gun runner\u2014did boycott Johnson\u2019s Paris peace talks. With the war still raging, Nixon claimed a narrow victory over Humphrey. He then made Kissinger his own national security adviser. \n\nIn the four years between the sabotage and what Kissinger termed \u201cpeace at hand\u201d just prior to the 1972 election, more than 20,000 US troops died in Vietnam. More than 100,000 were wounded. More than a million Vietnamese were killed. \n\nBut in 1973, Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the same settlement he helped sabotage in 1968.\n\nAccording to Parry, LBJ wanted to go public with Nixon\u2019s treason. But Clark Clifford, an architect of the CIA and a pillar of the Washington establishment, talked Johnson out of it. LBJ\u2019s close confidant warned that the revelation would shake the foundations of the nation. \n\nIn particular, Clifford told Johnson (in a taped conversation) that \u201csome elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I\u2019m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have \\[Nixon\\] elected. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country\u2019s best interests.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Clifford told LBJ that the country couldn\u2019t handle the reality that its president was a certifiable traitor, eligible for legal execution. \n\nFittingly, Clark Clifford\u2019s upper-crust career ended in the disgrace of his entanglement with the crooked Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI), which financed the terrorist group Al Qaeda and whose scandalous downfall tainted the Agency he helped found.\n\nJohnson lived four years after he left office, tormented by the disastrous war that destroyed his presidency and his retirement. Nixon won re-election in 1972, again with a host of dirty dealings, then became the first American president to resign in disgrace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBob Fitrakis is a Political Science Professor in the Social and Behavioral Sciences department at Columbus State Community College.

    "selftext":"Cricket was the hot topic of debate at our home today. My family is almost like a mini representative of India, some support the left and others support the right but mostly they're on the right. But still, they all watch cricket and are mostly fans of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.\n\nEverything isn't going well in our country. It hasn't even been a month since the attack on Pandits in J&K and the subsequent attack on our soldiers. What happened in Pulwama couple years ago was also gruesome and heart wrenching. On one hand, Pakistan is killing our soldiers and on other, I see Kohli and Harbhajan doing *jhappian* with Pak cricket players.\n\nNow, I understand that sportsmanship is different and doesn't have anything to do with national interests (that is what a pseudo liberal like Barkha or Rajdeep will tell us!). However, when I think from a soldier's perspective, I see them battling against a gruesome enemy and taking bullets on their bodies so that people like us can watch cricket comfortably on our TV screens, this is the uncomfortable truth that I refuse to digest. I thus argued this point with my family members and asked them to boycott cricket. \n\nBy watching cricket, we are enabling people like Kohli and Harbhajan who seem to live in a totally different world. They probably see them Pakis as just another team and not the enablers of \"Kashmir banega Pakistan\" narrative peddled by their country's ISI. But I refuse to see just this partial truth where ugly and stinking parts are hidden beneath the carpet. I have decided to boycott watching cricket until BCCI makes it a mandate that our players will wear a black ribbon as a protest mark for people killed in J&K due to their sponsored terrorism whenever they play against Pakistan.\n\nOf course, my family members laugh when I tell this and tell me to forget all this and just chill and watch cricket. To which I reply that what happens if the soldier at Siachen also thinks like this: *These guys seem to be doing jhappis and chilling while watching cricket, why am I wasting my time here? Let me also go and join them.* Have you ever thought what will happen in that case?\n\nI couldn't convince my own family members but I still want to voice my perspective and try to convince as many as possible. By watching cricket, we are enabling a crooked Lutyens mentality which doesn't play for the country but just for their salaries and BYJUS ad money. But the other side plays it as jihad as their coach Ramiz Raja himself declared in a Youtube video. What do you think? Are we doing the right thing by enabling an ecosystem which doesn't even care about the country and their consumer's sentiments? I leave this decision to you i.e. India!",

    "selftext":"*As we approach the end of the first cycle of the new World Test Championship, I wanted to see what would happen if the world championship was decided on a challenge basis, as in combat sports, i.e. to be the champ, you have to beat the champ. I added a caveat: the world title would not be on the line in every series played by the champion. For a team to get a shot at the title, it would have to:*\n\n1. *Tour the current champions as the #1 contender; or*\n2. *Tour the current champions after beating them at home; or*\n3. *Host the current champions after beating them away.*\n\n*To be the #1 contender, a team would have to beat the current #1 contender away from home. A team does not lose its #1 contender spot if another team wins the title using rules 2 or 3. However, a team that has earned a title shot through rules 2 and 3 would lose the shot if the title changes hands. A drawn series favours the incumbent, whether champion or #1 contender.*\n\n*After applying these rules to the existing history of Test cricket, I found that the lineal world championship has been contested* ***60 times by eight teams***. *In these posts, I will provide a brief history of these 60 series, spanning 138 years. By recounting this alternative history, I hope to demonstrate the soundness of this model of deciding the world Test champion and to revisit some of the most iconic series of all time, as well as to have something to do during the commercial breaks. (Parts* [*1*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cricket\/comments\/kxko5t\/the_lineal_world_championship_an_alternative\/)*,* [*2*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cricket\/comments\/kycmmt\/the_lineal_world_championship_an_alternative\/) *and* [*4*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cricket\/comments\/l3ra65\/the_lineal_world_championship_an_alternative\/)*)*\n\n\\--\n\n**PART THREE: PYROTECHNICS IN THE CARIBBEAN (1956-81)**\n\nAs standards improved throughout the cricketing world, the second half of the twentieth century saw an end to the duopoly over the world championship. With attendances dropping in the imperial metropole due to the rise of television, new powerhouses emerged in the former colonies. Controversies\u2014over apartheid, professional contracts, umpiring and short-pitched bowling\u2014occasionally affected the trajectory of the world championship, but cricket was the ultimate winner, with plenty of hard-fought series, world records and an ever-shifting balance of power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#25: ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA (c) (5 TESTS, 1956)**\n\nAfter losing to West Indies and Australia in 1950-51, England asserted dominance over the rest of the empire-turned-commonwealth. They beat New Zealand away and South Africa at home, fought to a 1-1 draw over five Tests in the Indian tour and comfortably beat them at home, and then won back the Ashes after 19 years. However, they lost the first two Tests of the 1954 tour of the West Indies, and could only draw the series, failing to take back the mantle of #1 contender. As a result, the world championship was not on the line during their heroic defence of the Ashes on Australian soil, in 1954-55, but the victory did entitle them to a title shot at home.\n\nShowers delayed play on the first day of the Nottingham Test and prevented play on the second. After Ray Lindwall pulled a thigh muscle and Alan Davidson broke an ankle, the remaining fast bowlers, Keith Miller (4\/69 in 33 overs) and Ron Archer (2\/51 in 31) bowled off-breaks to defensive fields, forcing England to declare at 217\/8 on the third day. England then lost Alan Moss, who pulled a stomach muscle while fielding, but Jim Laker and Tony Lock ran through the order to secure a nice 69-run lead. The English openers, Peter Richardson and Colin Cowdrey, forced the issue with attacking fifties, setting Australia 260 in four hours, but the champions shut shop and batted 86 overs for 120\/3.\n\nColin McDonald and Jim Burke gave Australia their best opening partnership against England in 26 years, but the rest of the team barely surpassed their score in a first-innings total of 285 at Lord's. But Miller's 10\/152 in 70.1 overs and a 97 by Richie Benaud, who came in to bat at 112\/6 in the second innings, secured Australia's first Test win on English soil since the Invincibles of 1948. England drew level at Leeds, after Peter May and Cyril Washbrook rescued the team from 17\/3 on the first day, and Laker and Lock together took 18\/194 in 137 overs. Then, at Manchester, well, Laker took 19\/90 on his own. Over twelve hours of play were lost to rain at The Oval, but Laker (4\/80 and 3\/8) had Australia at 27\/5 when play was called on the final day. England were world champions again, 22 years and six days after they lost the title on the same ground.\n\n*Result: England win, 2-1. Player of the Series: Jim Laker (46 wickets @ 9.60)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#26: ENGLAND v WEST INDIES (5 TESTS, 1957)**\n\nHaving preserved their status as #1 contender in 1954, the West Indies arrived in England three years later for a tilt at the world title, and Sonny Ramadhin took 7\/49 in the first innings at Edgbaston to dismiss the champions for 186. Collie Smith's 161, assisted by fifties from Clyde Walcott, Frank Worrell and Garry Sobers, secured a first-innings lead of 288. But Peter May (285\\*) and Colin Cowdrey (154) piled on 411 for the fourth wicket, and England had the challengers at 72\/7 after 60 overs when the game ended. A 152 by Cowdrey and 11\/98 by Trevor Bailey secured an innings victory at Lord's inside three days.\n\nTom Graveney scored 258 at Trent Bridge, and centuries by Peter Richardson and May pushed the total to 619\/6 declared. Worrell, promoted to opener, responded with 191\\* but, at the other end, Fred Trueman engineered a Windies collapse from 295\/3 to 317\/9 en route to a first-innings deficit of 247. Following on, Collie Smith's 168 saved the match. But the West Indies collapsed for 142, 132, 89 and 86 in the next four innings and England cemented their champion credentials.\n\n*Result: England retain, 3-0. Player of the Series: Peter May (489 runs @ 97.80)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#27: ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA (5 TESTS, 1961)**\n\nAustralia returned to England in 1961 as the only team to have beaten England in the past decade, having retaken the Ashes in 1958-59, and they struck the first blow, dismissing the champions for 195 in the first innings of the Birmingham Test. They then declared at 516\/9 on the third day, but persistent rain and centuries by Raman Subbarao and Ted Dexter saved the game. At Lord's, Alan Davidson (7\/92) and Graham McKenzie (6\/118) dismissed England for 206 and 202, and even a collapse of 19\/4 merely inconvenienced Australia's run chase of 71. Fred Trueman responded with 11\/88 at Leeds to square the series.\n\nBrian Statham took 5\/53 in the first innings at Manchester to dismiss Australia for 190. Half-centuries by Geoff Pullar, Peter May and Ken Barrington got England to 367, but a century by Bill Lawry set the champions a target of 256. Subbarao and Dexter took England to 150\/1, but Richie Benaud took 6\/70 to complete a thrilling 54-run win, which meant England would have to win the Oval Test to retain the title. Norm O'Neill (117), Peter Burge (181) and Brian Booth (71) ensured that Australia batted England out of the contest, and Subbarao's 137 helped England avoid another loss.\n\n*Result: Australia win, 2-1. Player of the Series: Bill Lawry (420 runs @ 52.50)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#28: AUSTRALIA v ENGLAND (5 TESTS, 1962-63)**\n\nBrian Booth's 112, Ken Mackay's 86\\* and Richie Benaud's 51 took Australia to 404 at the Gabba, but Ted Dexter (70), Ken Barrington (78) and Peter Parfitt (80) dragged England to within 15. The Australian top order all got starts to set England a target of 378, but the challengers batted out 83 overs to save the match. Fred Trueman's 5\/62 in the second innings ensured the first sub-300 total of the series at Melbourne, and David Sheppard scored a century to give England the 1-0 lead.\n\nAfter Australia took a 40-run first-innings lead at Sydney, Alan Davidson took 5\/25 to dismiss England for 104 and set up an eight-wicket victory. Centuries by Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill put the champions in the driving seat at Adelaide, but Barrington's 132 kept the title shot alive going into the final Test at the SCG. Barrington scored another century in a first-innings total of 321, but Peter Burge's 103 took Australia to 349 on the fourth day. Barrington scored 94 to set England 241 in 72 overs, but Lawry and Burge had an unbroken 82-run partnership to retain the title.\n\n*Result: Australia retain, 1-1. Player of the Series: Ken Barrington (582 runs @ 72.75)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#29: AUSTRALIA v WEST INDIES (5 TESTS, 1968-69)**\n\nThe West Indies again became the #1 contender after beating England in their 1963 and 1966 tours, but relinquished that status in 1967-68. However, they had beaten Australia at home in 1964-65, which meant that they still had a title shot when they toured Australia in 1968-69. It was an ageing side, however, lacking substantial pace threats to support Lance Gibbs and full of batsmen who were past their prime. Joey Carew and Rohan Kanhai got them to a great start at Brisbane, putting together 165 for the second wicket, but once they were dismissed, the other batsmen could only add a hundred more runs. Centuries by Bill Lawry and Ian Chappell got Australia to within 12 runs of the Windies total, but a young Clive Lloyd scored 129 to set Australia a target of 366. Captain Garry Sobers then took 6\/73 to seal a 125-run victory.\n\nIn the Boxing Day Test, however, Graham McKenzie took 8\/71 to bowl the West Indies out for 200, before Lawry (205) and Chappell (165) put together 298 runs for the second wicket en route to 510. John Gleeson then finished things off with 5\/61. In the New Year's Test at Sydney, a Doug Walters century got Australia a 283-run first-innings lead, and Gleeson's 4\/91 secured the victory. Another Walters century made sure the Windies could not square the series at Adelaide, and Lawry (151) and Walters (242) ensured another win at the SCG.\n\n*Result: Australia retain, 3-1. Player of the Series: Doug Walters (699 runs @ 116.50)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#30: AUSTRALIA v ENGLAND (7 TESTS, 1970-71)**\n\nKeith Stackpole (207) put together partnerships of 151 with Ian Chappell (59) and 209 with Doug Walters (112) to get Australia to 433 in the first innings at the Gabba, but eight English batsmen got starts to wrest away a 31-run lead. Ken Shuttleworth then took 5\/47 to bowl Australia out for 214, but there wasn't enough time for England to chase down the runs. The Perth Test was also drawn, thanks to centuries by Brian Luckhurst, Ian Redpath, Greg Chappell and John Edrich. After the Melbourne Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled, the two sides agreed to tack on a seventh Test to the already long series.\n\nIn the first Sydney Test, Geoff Boycott scored 77 and 142 to set Australia a target of 416, and John Snow took 7\/40 to seal a 299-run win. In the do-over at Melbourne, Ian Chappell (111) and Rod Marsh (92) took Australia to 493\/9 declared at the end of the second day. Luckhurst responded with 109 to get England within 101 runs and, after Australia set them a target of 271 in 58 overs, Boycott and Edrich remained unbeaten to preserve the series lead. Edrich (130) and Keith Fletcher (80) got England to 470 at Adelaide and, after Australia were bowled out for 235, Boycott scored an unbeaten 119 to set Australia 469 in 115 overs, but Stackpole (136 off 355) and Ian Chappell (104 off 278) kept the series alive with a 202-run partnership.\n\nIt was game on at the SCG when Australia bowled England out for 184 in the first innings, and recovered from 32\/3 to 264. Edrich and Luckhurst gave England a 98-run opening partnership, and almost everyone contributed to a second-innings total of 302, setting Australia a target of 223 to retain the title. Snow bowled Ken Eastwood in the first over, but was injured while fielding after his second over. Peter Lever had Ian Chappell caught behind with the score at 22. Redpath hung around for 66 balls to build a 49-run partnership with Stackpole before he was dismissed by the English captain, Ray Illingworth, who was filling in for Snow's overs, and Bob Willis dismissed Doug Walters for one. Illingworth then bowled Stackpole for 67, and Australia were 96\/5. Greg Chappell and Rod Marsh mounted some resistance, but it was all over early on the fifth day as Australia were bowled out for 160.\n\n*Result: England win, 2-0. Player of the Series: Geoff Boycott (657 runs @ 93.85)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#31: ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA (5 TESTS, 1972)**\n\nIan Chappell's Australia returned to England without ten of the 17 players who had made the 1968 tour, and the young team surrendered a 107-run first-innings lead in the opening Test at Old Trafford. However, 22-year-old Dennis Lillee took 6\/66 in the second innings and 24-year-old Rod Marsh, who came in at 120\/6, counter-attacked with 91 off 111 balls to put up a creditable fight in a losing cause. The Chappell brothers rescued the side from 7\/2 at Lord's to take a 36-run lead, and Bob Massey took 8\/53 to set up an eight-wicket victory. Centuries by Keith Stackpole and Ross Edwards set England a target of 451 at Nottingham, but Brian Luckhurst batted for nearly five and a half hours to ensure England lasted 148 overs to keep the series tied after three Tests.\n\nAustralia's hopes of recapturing the world title, however, was dealt a mortal blow when they lost six wickets for 19 runs at Leeds. Ashley Mallett took 5\/114 to keep things somewhat competitive, but Derek Underwood responded with 6\/45 to ensure England's target was only 20. In the Oval Test, Lillee took 10\/181 to set up a 242-run chase. Stackpole and Ian Chappell put together a 116-run second-wicket partnership, and Marsh and Paul Sheehan added 71\\* for the sixth wicket to square the series.\n\n*Result: England retain, 2-2. Player of the Series: Dennis Lillee (31 wickets @ 17.67)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#32: INDIA v ENGLAND (c) (5 TESTS, 1972-73)**\n\nHaving seen off a spirited challenge by their fiercest rivals, Ray Illingworth and Geoffrey Boycott made themselves unavailable for the winter tour to India and, with an eye towards the 1974-75 Ashes, the English selectors chose what the makeshift captain, Tony Lewis, would call \"an embryo team.\" None of its members had ever played in England, and only two of them had played twenty Tests. \"The Indians,\" *Wisden* noted, \"who never seemed to be referred to as anything except the world champions by their millions of followers, were a very confident side.\" \"Not just confident, we were a little bit over-confident,\" the Indian captain, Ajit Wadekar, later recalled. India had forced themselves into the title picture by winning away series against the West Indies and England in 1971, and the BCCI did not bother holding a training camp before the team's first ever title shot.\n\nOn the first morning of the Delhi Test, Geoff Arnold dismissed the Indian top three for 20 runs and finished with 6\/45 to bowl India out for 173. Bhagwath Chandrasekhar responded with 8\/79 to keep the deficit at 27. With India at 103\/5 in the second innings, Eknath Solkar and Farokh Engineer put on a century stand, setting England a target of 207. Bedi took two early wickets, but Barry Wood and Mike Denness added 56, before a century partnership between Lewis and Tony Greig saw the champions home. At Calcutta, the Indian spinners secured a 36-run first-innings lead, but Greig (5\/24) and Chris Old (4\/43) dismissed India for 155 in the second innings. Bedi (5\/63) and Chandrasekhar (4\/42) soon had England at 17\/4, and, despite Greig's 67, England fell short by 28 runs.\n\nIn the Madras Test, India had England at 110\/7, but Keith Fletcher's 97\\* with the tail salvaged a first-innings total of 242. Tiger Pataudi, who had returned to the side after scoring a century for South Zone in a tour match the previous week, scored 73 to get India a 74-run lead, while Bedi (4\/38) and Erapalli Prasanna (4\/16) kept India's target at 86. Old dismissed Engineer and Wadekar with the Indian score at 11, but Chetan Chauhan and Salim Durrani added 33 for the third wicket and, despite Pat Pocock's 4\/28, India took a 2-1 lead. A slow pitch at Kanpur meant that both teams batted for two days each and, even though England had India at 39\/4 on the final day, India took the series lead to Bombay. On a batting-friendly pitch, Engineer and Gundappa Viswanath scored centuries to take India to 448, before Fletcher and Greig did the same to take England to 480. Engineer and Sunil Gavaskar then put on 135 for the first wicket, ensuring India would redeem their millions of followers' tryst with destiny.\n\n*Result: India win, 2-1. Player of the Series: Bhagwath Chandrasekhar (35 wickets @ 18.91)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#33: INDIA v WEST INDIES (5 TESTS, 1974-75)**\n\nA few months after losing the world championship, England again ceded their #1 contender status to the visiting West Indies, and the 1974-75 season saw the first title match not featuring either England or Australia. Clive Lloyd's side embarked upon its tour of the Indian subcontinent without Garry Sobers and Rohan Kanhai, the most successful batsmen in their previous India tour. But Gordon Greenidge scored 93 on debut to give his side a 29-run first-innings lead, then added 207 with Lloyd (163) to bring up his maiden century and set the champions a target of 386 on a rain-affected Bangalore pitch. Having lost Tiger Pataudi and Farokh Engineer to injuries, India capitulated before lunch on the final day for 118. Then, after India were bowled out for 220 at Delhi, Viv Richards scored 192 to give the challengers a 273-run lead. Lance Gibbs took 6\/76 to seal an innings victory.\n\nAndy Roberts took 5\/50 to dismiss India for 233 on the first day of the Calcutta Test, before Roy Fredericks scored a century in a 240-run response. However, Gundappa Viswanath batted for over six hours to score 139 and set the West Indies a target of 310. Bishan Bedi (4\/52) and Bhagwath Chandrasekhar (3\/66) secured an 85-run victory. The Madras Test was played on a minefield, and Roberts took 7\/64 in the first innings to bowl India out for 190 before Erapalli Prasanna's 5\/70 kept the deficit to two runs. Viswanath and Anshuman Gaekwad rescued India from 85\/5 to set a target of 255, and the spin trio provided a 100-run victory.\n\nThe organisers decided to include a sixth day to facilitate a result in the deciding Test at Bombay. Lloyd won his first toss of the series, and scored an unbeaten 242 before declaring at 604\/6 on the third day. (Ninety minutes of play was lost on the second day after the crowd rioted to protest the police's handling of spectators who had rushed onto the field to congratulate Lloyd on reaching 200.) After the early wicket of Engineer, Sunil Gavaskar (86) and Eknath Solkar (102) put on a 168-run partnership over the rest of the day, while Viswanath (95) and Gaekwad (51) added 121 for the fifth wicket after the rest day, but India were bowled out, 198 runs short, on the fifth day. Fredericks and Greenidge put on a 75-run opening partnership, and all of the Windies top six got starts, as the challengers declared at 205\/3 after 40 overs, leaving India 404 runs to chase and win the match or, more realistically, bat out ten hours to retain the title with a draw. India lost Engineer, Gavaskar and Vishwanath on the fifth day, and Vanburn Holder's 6\/39 engineered a collapse early on the sixth to set up a 201-run victory.\n\n*Result: West Indies win, 3-2. Player of the Series: Andy Roberts (32 wickets @ 18.28)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#34: WEST INDIES v INDIA (4 TESTS, 1975-76)**\n\nIndia got their rematch a year later, as the new champions\u2014who had added the ODI championship to their kitty in the intervening summer\u2014sought to avenge their 1971 defeat to India at home. However, poor scheduling meant that the challengers went into the Barbados Test a day after making a 62-hour journey from New Zealand and, although the openers Sunil Gavaskar and Parthasarthi Sharma scored 51 runs in the first nine overs, the rest of the lineup contributed only 126 runs, collapsing to the leg spin of David Holford (5\/23). Viv Richards (142) and Alvin Kallicharran (93) then added 220 for the third wicket, while Clive Lloyd scored a century with the tail to secure a 311-run lead. Gavaskar then got out in the first over of the second innings, trying a hook shot against Andy Robers, and Gundappa Viswanath's 62 could not prevent an innings defeat.\n\nBishan Bedi's 5\/82 at Port of Spain meant that, despite Richards's 130, the West Indies could only score 241 after the first day was washed out. Gavaskar (156) and Brijesh Patel (115\\*) put together a 204-run partnership to allow India to declare late on the fourth day, at 402\/5. Srinivas Venkataraghavan dismissed Roy Fredericks in the final hour and, after Bhagwath Chandrasekhar got rid of the night watchman, Richards had to retire hurt with the score at 34\/2. Richards returned after Lawrence Rowe was dismissed for 47 soon after lunch, but was run out for 20. Lloyd, who had survived several chances, added 48 with Deryck Murray before both were dismissed just before the final hour. However, Bernard Julien and Andy Roberts hung around and protected the series lead. In the third Test, also at the Queen's Park Oval, Richards (177) and Lloyd (68) got the champions to 359 in the first innings, while Michael Holding took 6\/65 to bowl India out for 228. Kallicharran then scored a century to set India a target of 403 in a day and a half on a deteriorating pitch. At stumps on the fourth day, Gavaskar was unbeaten on 85 and India were at 134\/1. He was caught behind for 102, with the score at 177, but Mohinder Amarnath (85) added 159 with Vishwanath (112) and 56 with Patel (49\\*) to secure an improbable win.\n\nIndia finished the first day of the Kingston Test, which was shortened due to bad light, at 185\/1, but Holding took two wickets with the second new ball on the second morning, while Gaekwad and Patel were ruled out for the rest of the match after being hit by short balls. In an attempt to protect himself and Chandrasekhar from the Windies' hostile bowling, Bedi declared the innings at 306\/6, shortly before tea on the second day. Chandrasekhar expressed his gratitude by taking 5\/153 in 42 overs, as the champions took an 85-run lead. With Gaekwad, Viswanath and Patel\u2014as well as Bedi and Chandrasekhar, who injured fingers while attempting catches\u2014unable to bat, the remaining six batsmen only managed 97, and West Indies chased down the 12-run target in less than two overs.\n\n*Result: West Indies retain, 2-1. Player of the Series: Viv Richards (556 runs @ 92.66)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#35: WEST INDIES v AUSTRALIA (5 TESTS, 1977-78)**\n\nAfter dominating the West Indies at home, 5-1, just before the new champions defended their title against India, Bob Simpson's men were looking to win back the title after seven years. However, after rain delayed the start of play at the Queen's Park Oval for almost two hours, the pace trio of Andy Roberts, Colin Croft and Joel Garner exploited the variable bounce to run through the Australian batting for 90 in 35.1 overs. The openers added 79 in 14 overs to finish the day, while Alvin Kallicharran (127) and Clive Lloyd (86) added 170 for the fourth wicket the following day to take a 315-run lead. Roberts then took 5\/56 to wrap up an innings victory inside three days. After being asked to bat in the Barbados Test, Graeme Wood and Graham Yallop went into lunch at 104\/1, but Australia lost six wickets for 56 runs and were bowled out for 250 soon after tea. Jeff Thomson responded with 6\/77 to keep the deficit to 38. Roberts (4\/50) and Garner (4\/56) then dismissed Australia for 178 to set up a nine-wicket victory.\n\nHowever, a dispute between the players and selectors over World Series contracts before the Georgetown Test resulted in Lloyd's resignation as captain, and Kallicharran was asked to lead a team with six debutants, with Derick Parry the only other member of the team to have played in the first two Tests. Thomson (4\/56) and Wayne Clark (4\/65) dismissed the second-string side for 205, before three fifties gave the challengers an 81-run lead. Centuries by Basil Williams and Larry Gomes got the West Indies to 439, but Wood (126) and Craig Serjeant (124) added 251 to rescue Australia from 22\/3 and enable the team to chase down 352 with three wickets in hand. Kallicharran (92) and Williams (87) got the Windies to 292 in the first innings of the fourth Test, and Vanburn Holder took 6\/28 to secure a two-run lead. Set a target of 293 on the fourth morning, Australia collapsed against the spin of Parry (5\/15) and Raphick Jamadeen (3\/34) to lose by 198 runs. In the dead rubber at Kingston, Australia had West Indies nine wickets down in the final hour when the crowd rioted against a decision by umpire Wesley Malcolm\u2014who had been added to the match after the Australians protested against Douglas Sang Hue no-balling Bruce Yardley for chucking in the third Test\u2014and the match was abandoned as a draw.\n\n*Result: West Indies retain, 3-1. Player of the Series: Alvin Kallicharran (408 runs @ 51.00)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**#36: WEST INDIES v ENGLAND (5 TESTS, 1980-81)**\n\nEngland were back as #1 contenders after beating India 3-1 in the 1976-77 tour but, despite winning two Ashes in the interim, were licking their wounds after series defeats against Australia and the West Indies when they finally made it to the Caribbean for a shot at the title in early 1981 against a Windies side restored to full strength. After Ian Botham asked the champions to bat first on a Queen's Park Oval pitch with plenty of dampness, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes got the West Indies to 144\/0 at the end of a rain-shortened first day. Fifties by Clive Lloyd and Andy Roberts enabled a declaration at 426\/9 on the third day, and Colin Croft took 5\/40 to bowl England out for 178. Geoff Boycott scored 70 to prolong the inevitable while following on, but the Windies won by an innings and 79 runs.\n\nBob Willis was injured during the first Test and was replaced in the squad by Robin Jackman. However, the Guyanese government cancelled Jackman's visa because he had played in apartheid South Africa, and England refused to play the Georgetown Test in protest. Following negotiations with four Caribbean governments, Jackman was allowed to play in the subsequent Tests and the series went on. After twice missing the chance to captain his team in a world-championship game at his home ground for non-cricketing reasons, Lloyd scored a century at Bridgetown before the Windies pacers bundled England out for 122. Lloyd added 66 in the second innings, while Viv Richards scored 182\\*, to set a target of 523. Despite a Graham Gooch century, England lost by 298 runs and West Indies retained the title. The fourth Test was drawn after a day was lost to rain, while David Gower batted nearly eight hours for 154\\* to save the final Test.\n\n*Result: West Indies retain, 2-0.

It also meant that at the time of the announcement, two of the countries playing at least 10 will have to play in the qualifying tournament, and possibly miss the finals of the World Cup.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wzsqz1fc4yv21.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=743085686ab58b8941a58efc9e938abc84d21168\n\nFollowing the recent success, Ireland and Afghanistan were promoted to the ICC ODI Championship and have since been promoted to full members of the ICC, which has become the latest Test Cricket Nation. However, they still needed to qualify for the World Cup through the current process.\n\nAfghanistan won the qualifying tournament by defeating West Indies in the final. Both teams have qualified for the World Cup, despite hosting the qualifying tournament, Zimbabwe failed to reach the finals and for the first time since 1983, the World Cup will be reduced. The recently appointed full member Ireland will miss the World Cup for the first time since 2007 and for the first time no allies will participate in the World Cup.\n\nThe stability list for the tournament was released on April 26, 2018, after the completion of an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in Kolkata. The London stadium was named as a potential venue in the planning stages, and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, confirming that Pitch Dimensions would be consistent with the requirements for hosting ODI matches. However, when the fixtures were announced, the London stadium was not included as a venue.",

    "title":"Why won't the BCCI play Pakistan in the UAE?",
    "selftext":"Before I start this comment, let me point out that I believe that modern cricket is a massive business, and the pursuit of money and expansion of business provides the clues to most moves made in the game these days, rather than political or nationalistic issues.\n\nOver the past few months I've had many debates on the issue of India\u2019s tour to Pakistan. There are several reasons offered for all the issues that have taken place, and since I am not convinced by any of them, I\u2019ll be discussing them here.\n\n1. Pakistan is an evil, terror supporting state: this excuse is given quite often. After 2008, there is no stomach to play the team whose state is seen in India as directly responsible for the Mumbai atrocities. This reason is also offered sometimes when explaining why Pakistani players are excluded from the IPL. \nIMO this excuse is bullshit. For starters, having hosted Pakistan in 2013, there is already a precedent in place, which is further cemented by the fact that India have played Pakistan in various tournaments (World Cup, Asia Cup) in the years since the attacks. So clearly if there was a moral reason for not wanting to tour Pakistan, it is undercut by these realities. \nIndeed, I am not sure what message is sent out by having Pakistani coaches and umpires over regularly for the IPL \u2013 Wasim and Ramiz being over don\u2019t seem to violate ethics but Misbah does? Most importantly, if this is the issue then why doesn\u2019t the Indian government, whose permission is frequently invoked by the BCCI, come out and say something? Surely New Delhi\u2019s foreign policy towards Islamabad outranks cricketing matters, and if the Modi government wants to freeze out Pakistan, wouldn\u2019t they mention that?\n\n\n2. The UAE is a haven of fixing, and Shashank is cleaning up shop: this theory emerged after the BCCI\u2019s strange non-explanations for not touring UAE, and [this piece](http:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/sports\/dont-believe-the-hype-heres-really-why-india-refuses-to-play-pakistan-in-uae-2516182.html) puts together various reasons to explain this. \nOnce again though, this line of reasoning is untenable. For starters, the Pakistan team has had no accusations of fixing \u2013 save for a scurrilous report in the Daily Mail that has so far been dismissed \u2013 in the years since the 2010 scandal. So unlike that piece\u2019s implication, claiming that Pakistani players are suspicious is baseless. \nMost importantly, how exactly would moving the players away from the UAE and to Sri Lanka make a difference? The illegal betting market exists primarily in India, and most transactions are not affected by the location of the match. If the BCCI is worried about player contact, what exactly does Sri Lanka have to offer that the UAE doesn\u2019t? \nif anything, the most prominent fixing scandals in recent years have happened in the IPL, in India. First there was the case where Sreesanth (and others) were banned, and then the whole betting scandal where the fixing element was left confined to a sealed envelope. \nMany people on twitter have pointed to Shashank\u2019s desire for cleaning up the BCCI as the reason he\u2019s avoiding the UAE. However, given the [response (last paragraph)](http:\/\/gulfnews.com\/sport\/our-writers\/india-s-refusal-to-play-in-uae-is-arrogant-1.1624480) to the MoU (the BCCI said that since it was signed by Srini, they don\u2019t recognise it) it seems that this is the same old pattern of the new BCCI boss undoing and opposing everything done by his predecessor. \n\n3. Ten Sports and BCCI have issues: The series in SL will also be covered by Ten.\n\n\n4. There\u2019s ISIS in Dubai: security concerns have literally not stopped anyone in the world form going here, not even England or Australia or Rihanna, so this is bullshit.\n\n5. Dawood Ibrahim\u2019s in UAE and other conspiracies: if the matters here are truly related to matters beyond cricket, then its unclear why either the BCCI doesn\u2019t make reference to this or the Indian government itself comes out and says this. Indeed, given Modi\u2019s triumphant visit to the region, you would think the GoI would have plenty of leverage to get what it wants. That may not extend to getting D-bhai, but can surely guarantee whatever assurances the board wants.\n\n\n6. Shashank is very keen on establishing the Indian home season: this has been said by some journos, which if true represents a rather dickheaded impulse to ignore previously signed agreements and what is known to be the home tour of the other side. This reason also fails to explain why they would agree to Sri Lanka then. \n\nAs you might be able to tell, there is also little monetary incentive at play amongst any of the options laid out here, and as I mentioned, I\u2019m usually prone to seeing those as the main reason for driving such things. However, in this case it could also be an issue of incompetence and poor communication.\nMany people believed that the BJP government wanted to wait until the outcome of the Bihar elections before deciding on the tour, and that\u2019s why the board spent a lot of time vacillating. As some had predicted, the decision to go ahead with the series was announced after the elections. However, the opposition to touring UAE was more surprising to me. \nMy current, completely speculative take is that the BCCI was first waiting on the government, and anticipating that the much-predicted BJP win in Bihar would lead to a more assertive stance vs Pakistan, leading to a cancelled tour. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, they were definitely waiting on the polls and the government\u2019s reaction. \nMeanwhile, within the board itself, the new boss was looking to clean out the mess made by Srini and stamp his own authority on the job. One of these ways was to establish an Indian home test season, which would consolidate its Test marketing and sales and would require regular home series. Knowing that the PCB\u2019s finances (like those of just about every other cricketing entity in the world right now) depended on the tour, the board thought they would be able to strongarm their way to an Indian-hosted \u2018home\u2019 series for Pakistan, and hence kick off the Indian home season concept in a dramatic and lucrative way. At this point, the Shiv Sena fiasco and Shahryar threatening a WT20 boycott necessitated damage control.\nBy now, the BJP lost Bihar as well, leading to some of the party\u2019s old guard calling out its newer hawks. The political climate for the series was now more favourable, and so there was no valid reason left to call the tour off. Going to the UAE however would be too embarrassing, and more importantly, damaging to the BCCI\u2019s negotiating strength in the future. This led to Sri Lanka emerging as the compromise situation.\nMy only issue with this scenario is that it fails to explain why the BCCI didn\u2019t just tell the PCB to fuck off at any point. Given its dealings with most of the world in the recent past, it hasn\u2019t made sense why the board has let this drag out all the way here. It clearly has the clout and the temperament to bully its way. If, as per my reasoning, the refusal to tour the UAE was largely face-saving, then why didn\u2019t the board just call it off altogether? \nAs a friend has already mentioned, it still feels like the BCCI is looking for an excuse to get out of the current series, and could use political reasons to do so. The recent changes at the top means that Shashank would want any resumptions to happen on deals signed on his terms and conditions, and this one has come along too quickly for the board to react. \nTL;DR all the political and fixing reasons being offered for why the BCCI won\u2019t send a team to the UAE are largely untenable. My claim is that a new board wants to set up a new series at a later date, and is also avoiding this one due to association with the past chief.\n",

    "selftext":"Ok so wtf. If any of you have been following the recent series vs WI, you will have noticed all the empty stands. This is nothing new. It has been happening for a long time. For people outside India who are asking why this is so, considering India is such a cricket crazy country, I have a few points to make\n\n1) India is not a cricket crazy country but simply a patriotic one. Most people know next to nothing about cricket and these so called fans of the game are simply fans of their country. They want to see India win so they can have pride in themselves. These are the people who will only watch India matches and will not be interested at all in a close fought Ashes final (for example)\n\n2) There is an obsession with Batsmen in India. Everyone loves to bat and no one wants to bowl. Everyone loves to see fours and sixes and very few people (comparitively) want to see a fast bowler or a spinner outfox a batsman\n\n3) The BCCI recognizes this and because it is a business, promotes batting friendly flat tracks to increase run (and therefore money) flow.\n\n4) A good match in India is one in which lots of runs are scored. A close fought low scoring nailbiter in which Tendulkar got out for 15 or 20 is considered a failure.\n\n5) High scoring matches generally take longer to resolve. A match on a tough bowler friendly track can be finished in much less time. \n\n**Hence because Ad revenues are linked to how many times you run the ad, it is against the financial interests of the BCCI and the TV stations to prepare competitive pitches and in their BEST interest to prepare flat dead batting tracks.**\n\nThese dumb fucks are going to kill Test Cricket and no one gives a fuck because all we care about is Sehwag smashing fours and sixes in the IPL and the world cup.\n\nBOYCOTT Indian Cricket. Do not watch it on TV. It is a farce anyway.\n\n- Sincerely a Cricket Fan who is Indian and not an Indian Cricket Fan\n\n**EDIT: IF You Don't Understand the LBW Rule. You Are NOT a Cricket Fan**\n",
